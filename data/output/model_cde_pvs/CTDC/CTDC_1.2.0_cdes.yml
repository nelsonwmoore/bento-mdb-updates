      (host) of low immunological competence (deficient lymphoid tissue) who has been
      the recipient of immunologically competent lymphoid tissue from a donor who
      lacks at least one antigen possessed by the recipient host; the reaction, or
      disease, is the result of action of the transplanted cells against those host
      tissues that possess the antigen not possessed by the donor. Seen most commonly
      following bone marrow transplantation, acute disease is seen after 5-40 days
      and chronic disease weeks to months after transplantation, affecting, principally,
      the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and skin.

      lasting greater than or equal to 24 hours (or fatal within 24 hours) that cannot
      be attributed to another cause.  Diagnostic tests include CT scan, MRI, angiography,
      and EEG to locate and evaluate the extent of the hemorrhagic or ischemic damage
      in the brain parenchyma, coagulation studies, complete blood count, comprehensive
      metabolic panel, and urinalysis.

      sexual contact, sharing of contaminated needles, or transfusion of contaminated
      blood. Generalized lymphadenopathy, fever, weight loss, and chronic diarrhea
      are common symptoms of AIDS. The patients usually die either of opportunistic

      origin_definition: A syndrome resulting from the acquired deficiency of cellular
        immunity caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It is characterized
        by the reduction of the Helper T-lymphocytes in the peripheral blood and the
        lymph nodes. Symptoms include generalized lymphadenopathy, fever, weight loss,
        and chronic diarrhea. Patients with AIDS are especially susceptible to opportunistic
        infections, tuberculosis, candida infections, and cryptococcosis), and the
        development of malignant neoplasms (usually non-Hodgkin lymphoma and Kaposi
        sarcoma). The human immunodeficiency virus is transmitted through sexual contact,

    origin_definition: A progressive degenerative disorder of the central nervous
      system characterized by loss of dopamine producing neurons in the substantia
      nigra and the presence of Lewy bodies in the substantia nigra and locus coeruleus.
      Signs and symptoms include tremor which is most pronounced during rest, muscle
      rigidity, slowing of the voluntary movements, a tendency to fall back, and a

        ingested pyrrolizidine plant alkaloids. The clinical signs and symptoms include
        hyperbilirubinemia, hepatomegaly, and fluid retention.

    origin_definition: A humanized recombinant monoclonal antibody directed against

      the growth factor protein HER2, thereby inhibiting proliferation of HER2 overexpressing
      tumor cells.  Binding with HER2 protein also initiates an antibody-dependent
      cell cytotoxicity.(NCI)

        on the tumor cell surface, trastuzumab induces an antibody-dependent cell-mediated
        cytotoxicity against tumor cells that overexpress HER2. HER2 is overexpressed
        by many adenocarcinomas, particularly breast adenocarcinomas. (NCI04)

    origin_definition: The use of synthetic or naturally-occurring chemicals for the
      treatment of diseases.  Although this term may be used to describe any therapy
      involving the use of chemical-based agents, it is most commonly used to refer
      to the variety of chemical-based agents employed to treat cancer.  Cancer chemotherapy
      works by arresting or killing the growth and spread of cancer cells.  Because
      cancer cells usually divide much faster than normal cells, they are often very
      sensitive to the inhibitory actions of chemotherapeutic agents.  Chemotherapy
      may also include agents that enhance immune function or alter hormonal activity.

        electrophoresis, image analysis, mass spectrometry, amino acid sequencing,
        and bio-informatics to resolve comprehensively, to quantify, and to characterize
        proteins. The application of proteomics provides major opportunities to elucidate
        disease mechanisms and to identify new diagnostic markers and therapeutic
        targets.

        of pixel values for DNA microarray image analysis. The data includes an intensity
        value, standard deviation of the intensity, the number of pixels used to calculate
        the intensity value, a flag to indicate an outlier as calculated by the algorithm,
        and a user defined flag indicating whether the feature should be excluded
        from future analysis. The file also stores the previously stated data for
        each feature on the probe array.
