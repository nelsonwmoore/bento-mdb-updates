    origin_definition: An incompatibility reaction (which may be fatal) in a subject
      (host) of low immunological competence (deficient lymphoid tissue) who has been
      the recipient of immunologically competent lymphoid tissue from a donor who
      lacks at least one antigen possessed by the recipient host; the reaction, or
      disease, is the result of action of the transplanted cells against those host
      tissues that possess the antigen not possessed by the donor. Seen most commonly
      following bone marrow transplantation, acute disease is seen after 5-40 days
      and chronic disease weeks to months after transplantation, affecting, principally,
      the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and skin.

      origin_definition: A reaction, which may be fatal, in an immunocompromised subject
        (host) who has received an antigenically incompatible tissue transplant (graft)
        from an immunocompetent donor. The reaction is secondary to the activation
        of the transplanted cells against those host tissues that express an antigen
        not expressed by the donor, and is seen most commonly following bone marrow
        transplantation; acute disease is seen after 5-40 days, and chronic disease
        occurs weeks to months after transplantation.

      lasting greater than or equal to 24 hours (or fatal within 24 hours) that cannot
      be attributed to another cause.  Diagnostic tests include CT scan, MRI, angiography,
      and EEG to locate and evaluate the extent of the hemorrhagic or ischemic damage
      in the brain parenchyma, coagulation studies, complete blood count, comprehensive
      metabolic panel, and urinalysis.

    origin_definition: An infection caused by eukaryotic heterotrophic organisms that
      live as saprobes or parasites, including mushrooms, yeasts, smuts, molds, etc.
      They reproduce either sexually or asexually, and have life cycles that range
      from simple to complex. Filamentous fungi refer to those that grow as multicellular
      colonies (mushrooms and molds).

      nodes; opportunistic infections (usually pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, cytomegalovirus

      origin_definition: A disorder characterized by inflammation and damage of the
        hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells of the hepatic venules that leads to
        venular occlusion and hepatocellular necrosis. It is most often a conditioning-related
        toxicity that results as a complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
        (HSCT). It has also been described in populations of individuals who have
        ingested pyrrolizidine plant alkaloids. The clinical signs and symptoms include
        hyperbilirubinemia, hepatomegaly, and fluid retention.

        venular occlusion and hepatocellular necrosis. It is most often a conditioning-related
        toxicity that results as a complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
        (HSCT). It has also been described in populations of individuals who have
        ingested pyrrolizidine plant alkaloids. The clinical signs and symptoms include
        hyperbilirubinemia, hepatomegaly, and fluid retention.
