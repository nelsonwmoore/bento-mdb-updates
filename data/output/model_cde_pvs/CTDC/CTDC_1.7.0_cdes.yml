    origin_definition: A squamous cell carcinoma arising from the larynx.  It is the
      most common type of laryngeal carcinoma.  The site of origin within the larynx
      influences the symptoms, histologic characteristics, and clinical behavior of
      squamous cell carcinoma.  The laryngeal squamous cell carcinomas can be glottic,
      supraglottic, and transglottic.  Glottic carcinoma is the most frequent form
      of laryngeal carcinoma in the United States.  Microscopically, squamous cell
      carcinomas of the larynx are similar in their appearance to squamous cell carcinomas
      arising elsewhere (adapted from Sternberg's Diagnostic Surgical Pathology, 3rd
      ed., 1999).

      knee.  Microscopically, synovial sarcoma is classified as monophasic (with a
      spindle or epithelial cell component) or biphasic (with both spindle and epithelial
      cell components).  Synovial sarcomas can recur or metastasize to the lungs,

    origin_definition: A rare malignant cutaneous tumor seen in elderly patients.  Its
      usual location is on the head, neck and extremities.  The tumor is composed
      of small round cells with scanty cytoplasm arranged in a trabecular pattern,
      or in ill-defined nodules or in a diffuse pattern.  The tumor cells contain
      cytoplasmic membrane-bound dense core granules resembling neurosecretory granules.

      a specific KIT-expressing and KIT-signaling-driven mesenchymal tumor.  Until
      recently, surgery has been the only effective therapy for this tumor.  However,
      many patients still experience recurrence.  Conventional chemotherapy and radiation
      therapy have been of limited value.  A KIT tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib
      mesylate (also known as STI-571 or Gleevec), is now effective in the treatment
      of relapsed and unresectable cases.

        of ductal, NOS type. There is not significant inflammatory cell infiltrate
        present, despite the name of this carcinoma.

      it is classified as either a low grade or an undifferentiated (high grade) stromal
      sarcoma. The low grade endometrioid stromal sarcoma is characterized by the
      presence of oval to spindle-shape cells that resemble the cells of the endometrial
      stroma, without evidence of significant atypia and pleomorphism. Numerous small
      vessels are also present. The undifferentiated stromal sarcoma is characterized

    origin_definition: A malignant neoplasm originating from the surface ovarian epithelium.  It
      accounts for the greatest number of deaths from malignancies of the female genital
      tract and is the fifth leading cause of cancer fatalities in women.  It is predominantly
      a disease of older white women of northern European extraction, but it is seen
      in all ages and ethnic groups.  Adenocarcinomas constitute the vast majority
      of ovarian carcinomas.  The pattern of metastatic spread in ovarian carcinoma
      is similar regardless of the microscopic type.  The most common sites of involvement
      are the contralateral ovary, peritoneal cavity, para-aortic and pelvic lymph
      nodes, and liver.  Lung and pleura are the most common sites of extra-abdominal
      spread.  The primary form of therapy is surgical.  The overall prognosis of
      ovarian carcinoma remains poor, a direct result of its rapid growth rate and
      the lack of early symptoms.

      factors include country of birth, family history, menstrual and reproductive
      history, fibrocystic disease and epithelial hyperplasia, exogenous estrogens,
      contraceptive agents, and ionizing radiation. The vast majority of breast carcinomas
      are adenocarcinomas (ductal or lobular). Breast carcinoma spreads by direct
      invasion, by the lymphatic route, and by the blood vessel route. The most common
      site of lymph node involvement is the axilla.

      lymphomas that involve the thymus, e.g., lymphosarcoma, Hodgkin's disease (previously
      termed granulomatous thymoma), should not be regarded as thymoma. (Stedman,

    origin_definition: Also known as chromophil carcinoma, it represents a minority
      of renal cell carcinomas.  It can be hereditary or sporadic.  The sporadic papillary
      renal cell carcinoma is characterized by trisomy of chromosomes 7, 16, and 17,
      and loss of chromosome Y.  The peak incidence is in the sixth and seven decades.  It
      is classified as type 1 or 2, based on the cytoplasmic volume and the thickness
      of the lining neoplastic cells. The prognosis is more favorable than for conventional
      (clear cell) renal cell carcinoma. -- 2003

    origin_definition: A serious problem that may occur in cancer in which cancer
      cells spread from the original (primary) tumor to the meninges (thin layers
      of tissue that cover and protect the brain and spinal cord). It can happen in
      many types of cancer, but is the most common in melanoma, breast, lung, and
      gastrointestinal cancer. The cancer may cause the meninges to be inflamed.

    origin_definition: A malignant tumor that arises from hepatocytes. Hepatocellular
      carcinoma is relatively rare in the United States but very common in all African
      countries south of the Sahara and in Southeast Asia. Most cases are seen in
      patients over the age of 50 years, but this tumor can also occur in younger
      individuals and even in children. Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in
      males than females and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic
      alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. Serum elevation of alpha-fetoprotein occurs in
      a large percentage of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Grossly, hepatocellular
      carcinoma may present as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver
      involvement. Microscopically, there is a wide range of differentiation from
      tumor to tumor (well differentiated to poorly differentiated tumors). Hepatocellular
      carcinomas quickly metastasize to regional lymph nodes and lung. The overall
      median survival of untreated liver cell carcinoma is about 4 months. The most
      effective treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma is complete resection of the
      tumor. Lately, an increasing number of tumors have been treated with liver transplantation.

    origin_definition: A malignant liver neoplasm that occurs almost exclusively in
      infants, although isolated cases in older children and adults have been reported.
      Grossly, hepatoblastoma is solid, well circumscribed, and more often solitary
      than multiple. Microscopically, most of the tumors are composed exclusively
      of immature hepatocytic elements. About a fourth of hepatoblastomas contain
      a stromal component that may be undifferentiated or develop into bone or cartilage.
      The treatment of choice for hepatoblastoma is surgical excision with adjuvant
      therapy. Liver transplantation is being increasingly used as well.

      tumor arising from the adrenal cortical cells.  Symptoms are usually related
      to the excessive production of hormones, and include Cushing's syndrome and
      virilism in women.  Common sites of metastasis include liver, lung, bone, and
      retroperitoneal lymph nodes.  Advanced radiologic procedures have enabled the
      detection of small tumors, resulting in the improvement of the 5-year survival.

    origin_definition: A rare adenocarcinoma with poor prognosis, arising from the
      adenohypophysial cells of the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland or pre-existing
      adenomas.  The majority are hormonally functioning neoplasms, usually producing
      prolactin or ACTH.  The diagnosis is based on the presence of metastases.  Syndromes
      associated with pituitary gland carcinomas include hyperprolactinemia, Cushing
      disease, and acromegaly.

    origin_definition: A chronic myeloproliferative disorder characterized by an increased
      red blood cell production.  Excessive proliferation of the myeloid lineage is
      observed as well.  The major symptoms are related to hypertension or to vascular
      abnormalities caused by the increased red cell mass.  The cause is unknown.  With
      currently available treatment, the median survival exceeds 10 years.  (WHO,
      2001) -- 2003

      origin_definition: A chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by an
        increased red blood cell production. The bone marrow is hypercellular due
        to a panmyelotic proliferation typically characterized by pleomorphic megakaryocytes.
        The major symptoms are related to hypertension, splenomegaly or to episodes
        of thrombosis and/or hemorrhage.

    origin_definition: A malignant (clonal) hematologic disorder, involving hematopoietic
      stem cells and characterized by the presence of primitive or atypical myeloid
      or lymphoid cells in the bone marrow and the blood.  Leukemias are classified
      as acute or chronic based on the degree of cellular differentiation and the
      predominant cell type present.  Leukemia is usually associated with anemia,
      fever, hemorrhagic episodes and splenomegaly.  Common leukemias include acute
      myeloid leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphoblastic or precursor
      lymphoblastic leukemia, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia.  Treatment is vital
      to patient survival; untreated, the natural course of acute leukemias is normally
      measured in weeks or months, while that of chronic leukemias is more often measured
      in months or years. -- 2004

    origin_definition: An aggressive, predominantly extranodal, mature T-cell non-Hodgkin
      lymphoma.  It is characterized by an often angiocentric and angiodestructive
      cellular infiltrate composed of EBV positive NK/T cells.  The nasal cavity is
      the commonest site of involvement.  Patients often present with midfacial destructive
      lesions (lethal midline granuloma).  The disease may disseminate rapidly to
      various anatomic sites including gastrointestinal tract, skin, testis, and cervical
      lymph nodes.  It is also known as angiocentric T-cell lymphoma.  The term "polymorphic
      reticulosis" has been widely used to describe the morphologic changes seen in
      this type of lymphoma.  However, the latter term may also apply to lymphomatoid
      granulomatosis which is an angiocentric and angiodestructive EBV positive B-cell
      lymphoproliferative disorder.  -- 2003

      disease at diagnosis.  Morphologically, follicular lymphomas are classified
      as Grade 1, Grade 2, and Grade 3, depending on the percentage of the large lymphocytes
      present.  The vast majority of cases (70-95%) express the BCL-2 rearrangement
      [t(14;18)].  Histological grade correlates with prognosis.  Grades 1 and 2 follicular
      lymphomas are indolent and grade 3 is more aggressive (adapted from WHO, 2001).

    origin_definition: An aggressive, usually diffuse non-Hodgkin lymphoma composed
      of small to medium sized B-lymphocytes (centrocytes).  Most patients present
      with advanced stage disease with lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and bone
      marrow involvement.  The gastrointestinal tract is the most commonly affected
      extranodal site by this type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.  The vast majority of
      cases express the t(11;14)(q13;q32) resulting in the rearrangement of the BCL-1
      gene and the overexpression of cyclin D1 mRNA.

      (host) of low immunological competence (deficient lymphoid tissue) who has been
      the recipient of immunologically competent lymphoid tissue from a donor who
      lacks at least one antigen possessed by the recipient host; the reaction, or
      disease, is the result of action of the transplanted cells against those host
      tissues that possess the antigen not possessed by the donor. Seen most commonly
      following bone marrow transplantation, acute disease is seen after 5-40 days
      and chronic disease weeks to months after transplantation, affecting, principally,
      the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and skin.

      lasting greater than or equal to 24 hours (or fatal within 24 hours) that cannot
      be attributed to another cause.  Diagnostic tests include CT scan, MRI, angiography,
      and EEG to locate and evaluate the extent of the hemorrhagic or ischemic damage
      in the brain parenchyma, coagulation studies, complete blood count, comprehensive
      metabolic panel, and urinalysis.

    origin_definition: Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a pathological
      process in the body where the blood starts to coagulate throughout the whole
      body. This depletes the body of its platelets and coagulation factors, and there
      is an increased the risk of hemorrhage.  There are a variety of causes of DIC,
      all usually causing the release of chemicals into the blood that instigates
      the coagulation. (from Wikipedia)

      SYNDROME.: Used to indicate that either or both of two items or options may

      caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It is characterized by the
      reduction of the Helper T-lymphocytes in the peripheral blood and the lymph
      nodes; opportunistic infections (usually pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, cytomegalovirus
      (CMV) infections, tuberculosis, candida infections, and cryptococcosis); and
      the development of malignant neoplasms (usually non-Hodgkin''s lymphoma and
      Kaposi''s sarcoma). The human immunodeficiency virus is transmitted through
      sexual contact, sharing of contaminated needles, or transfusion of contaminated
      blood. Generalized lymphadenopathy, fever, weight loss, and chronic diarrhea
      are common symptoms of AIDS. The patients usually die either of opportunistic
      infections or malignant neoplasms. -- 2004'
