    origin_definition: The National Cancer Institute (NCI) reference terminology and
      ontology.  NCI Thesaurus (NCIt) provides controlled terminology for clinical
      care, translational and basic research, public dissemination of information
      and associated administrative activities. NCIt is updated monthly to support
      precise coding of data based on the most recent developments in the cancer and
      biomedical research community.  NCIt has rich textual and formal logic descriptions
      of biomedical concepts, including full text definitions, synonyms, a true is_a
      taxonomic structure, polyhierarchy, inferred partonomy, and other features that
      make it suitable for supporting accurate human understanding and complex computer
      processing.  NCIt has been produced by NCI Enterprise Vocabulary Services (EVS)
      since 1997, and adopted since then for use by numerous federal agencies, standards
      development and research organizations._Any natural, endogenously-derived, synthetic
      or semi-synthetic compound with pharmacologic activity. A pharmacologic substance
      has one or more specific mechanism of action(s) through which it exerts one
      or more effect(s) on the human or animal body. They can be used to potentially
      prevent, diagnose, treat or relieve symptoms of a disease. Formulation specific
      agents and some combination agents are also classified as pharmacologic substances.
