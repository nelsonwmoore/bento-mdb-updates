      fever, hemorrhagic episodes and splenomegaly.  Common leukemias include acute
      myeloid leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphoblastic or precursor
      lymphoblastic leukemia, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia.  Treatment is vital
      to patient survival; untreated, the natural course of acute leukemias is normally

        fever, hemorrhagic episodes, and splenomegaly. Common leukemias include acute
        myeloid leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphoblastic or precursor
        lymphoblastic leukemia, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Treatment is vital
        to patient survival; untreated, the natural course of acute leukemias is normally
        measured in weeks or months, while that of chronic leukemias is more often
        measured in months or years.

    origin_definition: A clonal hematopoietic disorder characterized by dysplasia
      and ineffective hematopoiesis in one or more of the hematopoietic cell lines.
      The dysplasia may be accompanied by an increase in myeloblasts, but the number
      is less than 20%, which, according to the WHO guidelines, is the requisite threshold
      for the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia. It may occur de novo or as a result
      of exposure to alkylating agents and/or radiotherapy. (WHO, 2001)

    origin_definition: The National Cancer Institute (NCI) reference terminology and
      ontology.  NCI Thesaurus (NCIt) provides controlled terminology for clinical
      care, translational and basic research, public dissemination of information
      and associated administrative activities. NCIt is updated monthly to support
      precise coding of data based on the most recent developments in the cancer and
      biomedical research community.  NCIt has rich textual and formal logic descriptions
      of biomedical concepts, including full text definitions, synonyms, a true is_a
      taxonomic structure, polyhierarchy, inferred partonomy, and other features that
      make it suitable for supporting accurate human understanding and complex computer
      processing.  NCIt has been produced by NCI Enterprise Vocabulary Services (EVS)
      since 1997, and adopted since then for use by numerous federal agencies, standards
      development and research organizations._Any abnormal condition of the body or
      mind that causes discomfort, dysfunction, or distress to the person affected
      or those in contact with the person. The term is often used broadly to include
      injuries, disabilities, syndromes, symptoms, deviant behaviors, and atypical
      variations of structure and function.

    origin_definition: A DNA sequencing technique that can differentiate cytosine
      from 5-methylcytosine in a DNA sample. First, a denatured DNA sample is treated
      with bisulfite which converts non-methylated cytosine to uracil. Next, the sample
      is amplified using a PCR method that does not discriminate between non-methylated
      and methylated sequences. The amplified DNA is subjected to nucleotide sequencing.
      The resulting sequence is compared to an identical control sample of DNA that
      was not treated with bisulfite. Unmethylated cytosines will be displayed as
      cytosines in the control sample and as thymines in the bisulfite-treated sample.

        It is similar to Hi-C sequencing except that the ligations are performed on
        a solid substrate rather than in solution. This enhances the signal-to-noise
        ratio, thereby facilitating a detailed analysis of interactions within and
        between chromosomes.

        process involves the patient fixating at the Snellen Chart, while the clinician
        presents a variety of lenses and alters the power of the lenses in the trial
        frames according to the patient's subjective responses regarding improvements
        to their vision.

    origin_definition: An imaging technique that uses a small dose of a radioactive

      infection or degenerative disorders. The tracer, which is either injected into
      a vein or swallowed, travels through the bloodstream to the target organ, and
      emits gamma rays, which are detected by a gamma camera and analyzed by a computer
      to form an image of the target organ.

      It is a compound gland composed of both exocrine and endocrine tissues. The
      endocrine pancreas makes insulin so that the body can use glucose (sugar) for
      energy. The exocrine pancreas makes enzymes that help the body digest food.
      Spread all over the pancreas are areas called the Islets of Langerhans. The
      cells in these areas each have a special purpose. The alpha cells make glucagon,
      which raises the level of glucose in the blood; the beta cells make insulin;
      the delta cells make somatostatin. There are also PP cells and D1 cells, about
      which little is known.'

      origin_definition: A bi-lobed organ surrounded by a connective tissue capsule.
        It is located in the upper anterior portion of the chest, behind the sternum.
        It is composed predominantly of lymphocytes and fewer epithelial cells. Connective
        tissue septa separate the lobes into lobules. The lobules contain an outer
        portion (cortical zone) which is rich in lymphocytes and an inner portion
        (medullary zone) which is rich in epithelial cells. It is an organ essential
        for the development of the immune system. Its function is the maturation of
        the progenitor lymphoid cells to thymocytes and subsequently to mature T-cells.
        It reaches its greatest weight at puberty and subsequently begins to involute.

    origin_definition: A technique for measuring the gamma radiation produced by collisions
      of electrons and positrons (anti-electrons) within living tissue. In positron
      emission tomography (PET), a subject is given a dose of a positron-emitting
      radionuclide attached to a metabolically active substance (for example, 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose
      (FDG), which is similar to a naturally occurring sugar, glucose, with the addition
      of a radioactive fluorine atom). When living tissue containing the positron
      emitter is bombarded by electrons, gamma radiation produced by collisions of
      electrons and positrons is detected by a scanner, revealing in fine detail the
      tissue location of the metabolically-active substance administered.

      light waves that reflect off the internal microstructure within the biological
      tissues. The frequencies and bandwidths of infrared light are orders of magnitude
      higher than medical ultrasound signals, resulting in greatly increased image
      resolution, 8-25 times greater than any existing modality. In addition to providing
      high-level resolutions for the evaluation of microanatomic structures OCT is
      also able to provide information regarding tissue composition.

    origin_definition: A volatile liquid prepared by fermentation of certain carbohydrates.
      Alcohol acts as a central nervous system (CNS) depressant, a diuretic, and a
      disinfectant. Although the exact mechanism of CNS depression is unknown, alcohol
      may act by inhibiting the opening of calcium channels, mediated by the binding
      of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) to GABA-A
      receptors, or through inhibitory actions at N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type
      glutamate receptors. Alcohol inhibits the production of antidiuretic hormone,
      thereby producing diuresis that may lead to dehydration. This agent kills organisms
      by denaturing their proteins.

        water reabsorption in the proximal tubule in the kidney leading to an increase
        in water and sodium excretion and a reduction in blood volume. Administered
        rectally, glycerin exerts a hyperosmotic laxative effect by attracting water
        into the rectum, thereby relieving constipation. In addition, glycerin is
        used as a solvent, humectant and vehicle in various pharmaceutical preparations.

      origin_definition: A method for highly multiplexed immunofluorescent imaging
        of cells in various formats, such as tissue sections and multi-well tissue
        culture plates, using fluorescent microscopy. Images are generated using an
        iterative, cycling process in which images of expressed fluorescently-tagged
        proteins, fluorescent dyes, or fluorescently-tagged primary or secondary antibodies
        can be serially collected from the same sample and then those images can be
        assembled into a high-dimensional representation of the spatial relationships
        between the targets of interest.
